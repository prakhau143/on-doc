# Simulation 
The simulation of a medical toolkit which has been designed to enhance medical training and decision-making processes. The toolkit aims to provide healthcare professionals with a realistic and immersive simulation environment that replicates various medical scenarios and procedures .

## objective
The objective of an online doctor appointment system is to facilitate the efficient and convenient scheduling of medical consultations between patients and healthcare providers. This system aims to streamline the appointment booking process, improve accessibility to healthcare services, and enhance the overall patient experience.
Convenience: The primary objective is to provide patients with a convenient way to schedule appointments without the need for phone calls or in-person visits. Patients can book appointments anytime, anywhere, using a web browser or a mobile app.
Accessibility: The system aims to make healthcare services more accessible to patients, particularly those with mobility issues, busy schedules, or living in remote areas. By allowing patients to browse through available doctors, specialties, and appointment slots, it ensures that they can find suitable care providers easily.
Efficiency: By automating the appointment booking process, the system improves efficiency for both patients and healthcare providers. It reduces administrative workload, minimizes waiting times, and optimizes resource utilization within healthcare facilities.
Transparency: The system promotes transparency by providing patients with information about doctors' availability, qualifications, and patient reviews. This helps patients make informed decisions when choosing their healthcare provider.
Communication: It facilitates better communication between patients and healthcare providers by sending automated appointment reminders, notifications of any changes or cancellations, and follow-up instructions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
